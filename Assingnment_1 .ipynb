    "In programming, expressions and statements are fundamental concepts that are used to write code. Here are the key differences between expressions and statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression:\n",
    "- An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value.\n",
    "- Expressions can be simple, like 5 + 3, or complex, like 2 * (x + y) / (z - 1).\n",
    "- Examples of expressions include arithmetic expressions, logical expressions, and function calls.\n",
    "- Expressions can be used within statements to compute values or perform operations.\n",
    "- Expressions can be part of statements, but a statement can't be part of an expression.\n",
    "- In most programming languages, expressions can be used wherever a value is expected.\n",
    "Statement:\n",
    "- A statement is a complete instruction that performs some action.\n",
    "- Statements can include expressions, but they can also include keywords, control structures, and other elements that perform a specific task.\n",
    "- Examples of statements include variable declarations, assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions.\n",
    "- Statements are typically terminated by a semicolon (;) in languages like C, C++, Java, and JavaScript.\n",
    "- Statements are executed sequentially unless control flow statements like loops and conditionals are used to alter the flow of execution.\n",
    "- Statements are often used to control the flow of a program, such as deciding which code to execute based on conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example : \n",
    "Assignment Statement: 'spam = 10'\n",
    "    This is a statement because it assigns the value '10' to the variable 'spam'. ir performs the action of storing the value in the variable.\n",
    "    The expression here is '10' which evaluates to the integer '10'."
